### Question:
Gracie and Joe are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Joe chooses the point $1+2i$. Gracie chooses $-1+i$. How far apart are Gracie and Joe's points?
### Some Steps:
Step 1: The distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in the complex plane is given by the formula $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$.
Step 2: In this case, Joe's point is $(1,2)$ and Gracie's point is $(-1,1)$.
Step 3: The distance between their points is $\sqrt{((-1)-(1))^2+((1)-(2))^2}=\sqrt{(-2)^2+(-1)^2}=\sqrt{4+1}=\sqrt{6}$.

<THINKING>:
Step 1: This step is correct.
Step 2: This step is correct.
Step 3: This step is incorrect. The error occurred in the addition of the squared terms. Instead of $4+1=6$, the correct result is $4+1=5$, leading to the final answer $\sqrt{5}$

<CORRECT>:

### Question:
The function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies\n\[f(x) + 2f(1 - x) = 3x^2\]for all $x.$  Find $f(4).$
### Some Steps:
Step 1: What is the given functional equation when $x = 4$? Substituting $x = 4$ into the given functional equation results in \[f(4) + 2f(-3) = 32.\] The answer is $f(4) + 2f(-3) = 32.$
Step 2: What is the given functional equation when $x = -3$? Substituting $x = -3$ into the given functional equation results in \[f(-3) + 2f(4) = 27.\] The answer is $f(-3) + 2f(4) = 27.$

<THINKING>:
Step 1: This step is incorrect. Substituting $x = 4$ into $3x^2$ results in \[3*(4)^2=3*16=48.\].
Step 2: This step is correct.

<CORRECT>: 
Step 1: What is the given functional equation when $x = 4$? Substituting $x = 4$ into the given functional equation results in \[f(4) + 2f(-3) = 48.\] The answer is $f(4) + 2f(-3) = 48.$
Step 2: What is the given functional equation when $x = -3$? Substituting $x = -3$ into the given functional equation results in \[f(-3) + 2f(4) = 27.\] The answer is $f(-3) + 2f(4) = 27.$



### Question:
What is the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ for which $\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer?
### Some Steps:
Step 1: We want $\frac{n+6}{n}$ to be an integer. This means that $n+6$ must be divisible by $n$.
Step 2: Since $n$ is a positive integer, $n+6$ must be greater than $n$.

<THINKING>:
Step 1: This step is correct.
Step 2: This step is correct.

<CORRECT>: 
Step 1: We want $\frac{n+6}{n}$ to be an integer. This means that $n+6$ must be divisible by $n$.
Step 2: Since $n$ is a positive integer, $n+6$ must be greater than $n$.



### Question:
Circle $T$ has its center at point $T(-2,6)$. Circle $T$ is reflected across the $y$-axis and then translated 8 units down. What are the coordinates of the image of the center of circle $T$?
### Some Steps:
Step 1: Reflecting a point across the $y$-axis negates its $x$-coordinate.
Step 2: So, the image of point $T(-2,6)$ after reflecting across the $y$-axis is $(-(-2),6)=(2,6)$.
Step 3: Then, translating a point down 8 units adds 8 from its $y$-coordinate.
Step 4: So, the image of point $(2,6)$ after translating down 8 units is $(2,6+8)=(2,14)$. Therefore, the coordinates of the image of the center of circle $T$ are $\boxed{(2,14)}$.

<THINKING>:
Step 1: This step is correct.
Step 2: This step is correct.
Step 3: This step is incorrect. Translating a point down by 8 units subtracts 8 from its y-coordinate, not adds.
Step 4: This step is incorrect. The y-coordinate should be $6-8=-2$, so the final coordinates are $(2,-2)$, not $(2,14)$

<CORRECT>: 
Step 1: Reflecting a point across the $y$-axis negates its $x$-coordinate.
Step 2: So, the image of point $T(-2,6)$ after reflecting across the $y$-axis is $(-(-2),6)=(2,6)$.
Step 3: Then, translating a point down 8 units subtracts 8 from its $y$-coordinate.
Step 4: So, the image of point $(2,6)$ after translating down 8 units is $(2,6-8)=(2,-2)$. Therefore, the coordinates of the image of the center of circle $T$ are $\boxed{(2,-2)}$.



### Question:
Find the distance between the points $(2,1,-4)$ and $(5,8,-3).$
### Some Steps:
Step 1: What is the difference in the x-coordinates of the two points? The difference is $2 - 5 = -3$. The answer is -3.
Step 2: What is the difference in the y-coordinates and the z-coordinates of the two points? The difference in the y-coordinates is $1 - 8 = -7$ and in the z-coordinates is $-4 + 3 = -1$. The answers are -7 and -1 respectively.
