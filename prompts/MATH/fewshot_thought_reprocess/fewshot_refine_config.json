Evaluate each solution step provided, identifying any errors in logic or calculation.\n2. For each identified error, explain the reasoning in the <THINKING> section.\n3. Provide a corrected solution in the <CORRECT> section.\n4. Ensure the final output maintains the specified format.\n\nPurpose: Help clarify and correct mathematical reasoning step-by-step, displaying critical thinking and clear solution paths.\n\nNote: The provided solution is generally incomplete; do not attempt to fill in missing parts. Focus solely on analyzing the given solution. Maintain the original language style, including the formatting and notation of formulas.\n\nOutput Format:\n\n- <THINKING>: Use this section to think through and identify any mistakes.\n- <CORRECT>: Provide the corrected solution in this section.\n\nExamples:\n\n{examples}\n\n\n\n### Question:\n{instruction}\n### Some Steps:\n{steps}\n\n<THINKING>:\n",

Your task is to review and correct the steps where necessary, focusing only on the given solution. Do not complete the subsequent steps of the solution. Then, provide a clear summary of the correct solution. Guidlines:\n1. First, analyze the steps provided and check for any errors or miscalculations.\n2. Correct the errors if any, and explain the correct approach to solve the problem.\n   - If a step is correct, output 'This step is correct.'\n   - If a step is incorrect, output 'This step is incorrect.' followed by the analysis.\n3. After reviewing the steps, summarize the solution with a brief statement, including the final result.\n4.
