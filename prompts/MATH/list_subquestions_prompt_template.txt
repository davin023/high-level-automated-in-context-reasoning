Question 1: Ben rolls four fair 20-sided dice, and each of the dice has faces numbered from 1 to 20. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?
Question 1.1: What is the probability that a 20-sided die will show an even number?
Answer 1.1: Since there are 10 even numbers and 10 odd numbers, there is a $\frac{1}{2}$ probability for an even outcome. The answer is $\frac{1}{2}$.
Question 1.2: How many ways can exactly two of the four dice show an even number?
Answer 1.2: We can choose 2 dice out of 4 to show even numbers in $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. The answer is 6.
Question 1.3: What is the probability that in one of these ways, the chosen dice show even numbers and the others show odd numbers?
Answer 1.3: For each way, the probability is $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^4=\frac{1}{16}$. The answer is $\frac{1}{16}$.
Question 1.4: Now we can answer the question: What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?
Answer 1.4: The probability is $6\cdot \frac{1}{16}=\boxed{\frac{3}{8}}$. The answer is $\frac{3}{8}$.

Question 3: Juan takes a number, adds $2$ to it, multiplies the answer by $2$, subtracts $2$ from the result, and finally divides that number by $2$. If his answer is $7$, what was the original number?
Question 3.1: What is the equation that represents the operations Juan performs on the original number to get the answer $7$?
Answer 3.1: The operations Juan performs can be represented by the equation $(2(n + 2) - 2) / 2 = 7$. The answer is $(2(n + 2) - 2) / 2 = 7$.
Question 3.2: What is the value of $n$ when the equation is solved?
Answer 3.2: Solving the equation gives $n = 6$. The answer is 6.
Question 3.3: Now we can answer the question: What was the original number?
Answer 3.3: The original number was $\boxed{6}$. The answer is 6.

Question 4: Find the distance between the points $(2,1,-4)$ and $(5,8,-3).$
Question 4.1: What is the difference in the x-coordinates of the two points?
Answer 4.1: The difference is $2 - 5 = -3$. The answer is -3.
Question 4.2: What is the difference in the y-coordinates of the two points?
Answer 4.2: The difference in the y-coordinates is $1 - 8 = -7$. The answer is -7.
Question 4.3: What is the difference in the z-coordinates of the two points?
Answer 4.3: The difference in the z-coordinates is $-4 + 3 = -1$. The answer is -1.
Question 4.4: Now we can answer the question: What is the distance between the two points?
Answer 4.4: The distance is $\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-7)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 49 + 1} = \sqrt{59}$. The answer is $\sqrt{59}$.

Question 5: For the graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, the vertex of the parabola is $(3,7)$ and one of the $x$-intercepts is $(-2,0)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the other $x$-intercept?
Question 5.1: What is the general form of a quadratic function given its vertex?
Answer 5.1: The general form of a quadratic function with vertex $(h, k)$ is $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$. Here, the vertex is $(3, 7)$, so the function can be expressed as $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 7$. The answer is $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 7$.  
Question 5.2: What is the value of $y$ when $x = -2$?  
Answer 5.2: Substituting $x = -2$ into the vertex form gives $y = a(-2 - 3)^2 + 7 = 0$. Simplifying, we have $25a + 7 = 0$. Thus, $a = -\frac{7}{25}$. The answer is $a = -\frac{7}{25}$.  
Question 5.3: What is the quadratic function in standard form using the value of $a$?  
Answer 5.3: Substituting $a$ back into the vertex form gives $y = -\frac{7}{25}(x - 3)^2 + 7$. Expanding this, we find $y = -\frac{7}{25}(x^2 - 6x + 9) + 7$, which simplifies to $y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x + \left(7 - \frac{63}{25}\right)$. The answer is $y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x + \frac{7}{25}$.  
Question 5.4: What is the sum of the $x$-intercepts given the quadratic equation?  
Answer 5.4: The sum of the $x$-intercepts can be derived from the vertex. Since one intercept is at $-2$ and the vertex $x$-coordinate is $3$, the other intercept can be calculated using the formula: $x_1 + x_2 = 2 \times 3$. Therefore, $-2 + x_2 = 6$. The answer is $x_2 = 8$.  
Question 5.5: Now we can answer the question: What is the $x$-coordinate of the other $x$-intercept?  
Answer 5.5: The $x$-coordinate of the other $x$-intercept is $8$. The answer is $8$.
Done!

Question 6: The function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies\n\[f(x) + 2f(1 - x) = 3x^2\]for all $x.$  Find $f(4).$
Question 6.1: What is the given functional equation when $x = 4$?
Answer 6.1: Substituting $x = 4$ into the given functional equation results in \[f(4) + 2f(-3) = 48.\] The answer is $f(4) + 2f(-3) = 48.$
Question 6.2: What is the given functional equation when $x = -3$?
Answer 6.2: Substituting $x = -3$ into the given functional equation results in \[f(-3) + 2f(4) = 27.\] The answer is $f(-3) + 2f(4) = 27.$
Question 6.3: What do we obtain by doubling the second equation and then subtracting the first equation from it?
Answer 6.3: Doubling the second equation gives us $2f(-3) + 4f(4) = 54.$ Subtracting the first equation $f(4) + 2f(-3) = 48$ from this, we get $3f(4) = 6.$ The answer is $3f(4) = 6.$
Question 6.4: Now we can answer the question: What is $f(4)$?
Answer 6.4: Dividing both sides of the equation $3f(4) = 6$ by 3, we find that $f(4) = \boxed{2}.$ The answer is 2.
